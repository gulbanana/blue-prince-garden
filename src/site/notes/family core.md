from [[rooms/estate/Wine Cellar\|Wine Cellar]], 53 - [[rooms/estate/Vault\|Vault]] box 53 opened with key 8 (the sum of its digits)
contains a letter from [[dramatis personae/Herbert S. Sinclair\|Herbert S. Sinclair]] describing a bequest from [[dramatis personae/Auravei of Trinsdale\|Auravei of Trinsdale]] to [[dramatis personae/Simon H. Sinclair\|Simon H. Sinclair]] which neither brother solved - this cipher:
```
PIGS SAND MAIL DATE HEAD
CLAM PEAK HEAT JOYA WELL
TOAD CARD WILL TAPE LEGS
TREE ROAD MAID SLAB ROCK
HAND VASE SAFE CLAY TOES
```

treating each word as a numeric core with letter-number mappings:
```
PIGS = 16 9 7 19  = +16 -9 /7 x19 = 19 = S
SAND = 19 1 14 4  = +19 /1 -14 x4 = 20 = T
MAIL = 13 1 9 12  = +13 -1 x9 /12 = 9 = I
DATE = 4 1 20 5   = 4 -1 x20 /5 = 12 = L
HEAD = 8 5 1 4    = 8 -5 /1 *4 = 12 = L
CLAM = 3 12 1 13  = W
PEAK = 16 5 1 11  = A
HEAT = 8 5 1 20   = T
JOYA = 10 15 25 1 = +10 x15 /25 -1 = 5 = E
WELL = 23 5 12 12 = R
TOAD = 20 15 1 4  = T
CARD = 3 1 18 4   = I
WILL = 23 9 12 12 = N
TAPE = 20 1 16 5  = T
LEGS = 12 5 7 19  = S
TREE = 20 18 5 5  = B
ROAD = 
MAID = 13 1 9 4   = A
SLAB = 
ROCK = 
HAND = 
VASE = 
SAFE = 
CLAY = 
TOES = 
```

solution:
```
STILL WATER TINTS 
```
