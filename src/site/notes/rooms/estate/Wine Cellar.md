 why is the year wrong? marigold crest shouldn't be 700 years ago
* see the crests in [[rooms/estate/Room 46\|Room 46]]
* MCCXIII =1208, looks like a safe code. 
* september 12 or december 8 (D08 = the study safe)
* the last latin (erajan?) numerals i saw (CIX) were also a code. 

as core: 
```
1 2 0 8
+1 /2 -0 *8 = 4
```
sum of digits (per blue note): 11

"first number is one numeral, the rest are each two numerals"

```
1000 200 11 2
+1000 /200 x11 -2 = 53
```
core 53, sum 8?
